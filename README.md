# conjure-up [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/conjure-up/conjure-up.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/conjure-up/conjure-up)
> Installing big software like whoa.

# what it is

Ever wanted to get started with Kubernetes, Deep Learning, Big Data but didn't want
to go through pages and pages of "Getting Started" documentation?

Then **conjure-up** is for you!

This is the runtime application for processing spells to get those **big software**
solutions up and going with as little hindrance as possible.

# installation

> Ubuntu and macOS

## Ubuntu

```
$ sudo snap install conjure-up --classic
```

## macOS

```
$ brew install conjure-up
```

# how to use

## Run the installer interactively

You may want to learn a little bit about what you're installing, right? This
method provides you with a tutorial like approach without being overburdening.

You can read through descriptions of the software along with ability to set a
few config options before deploying. Or, just hold down the enter button and
it'll choose sensible defaults for you.

```
$ conjure-up
```

## Run the installer non-interactively (headless mode)

Already been through the guided tour? Not keen on holding down the enter button
on your keyboard? Not a problem, easily get your **big software** up and running
with all the sensible defaults in place.

```
$ conjure-up canonical-kubernetes localhost
```

Note that some spells require sudo for certain steps.  When running in headless
mode, conjure-up should be run with a user with passwordless sudo enabled (or
sudo should be pre-authorized before invoking conjure-up).

## Destroying deployments

```
$ conjure-down
```
